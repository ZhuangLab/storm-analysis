dao3d_2d - Basic analysis with 3D-DAOSTORM. A good place to start as the other
           analysis programs work in a similar manner.

dao3d_zcal - How to measure z defocus curves for 3D astigmatism imaging
             using 3D-DAOSTORM.

dbscan_clustering - Using DBSCAN to cluster localizations.

estimating_2D_fitting_precision - How to estimate the average 2D localization
                                  precision.

gauss_fitting_cramer_rao - Calculating resolution for 2D Gaussian fitting
                           based on Cramer-Rao bounds.

micrometry_mapping - Using micrometry to find the best affine transform between
                     two images.

scmos_cal - How to calibrate your sCMOS camera.

spliner_measure_psf - How to measure a PSF for Spliner.

voronoi_clustering - Using Voronoi diagrams to cluster localizations.
