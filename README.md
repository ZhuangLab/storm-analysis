## storm-analysis ##
This is a repository of code developed in the [Zhuang Lab](http://zhuang.harvard.edu/) for analysis of STORM movies. Some algorithms were developed in other groups and ported to Python.

The code is now located in the storm_analysis folder.

## Installation ##
You will need Python and you will need the storm-analysis directory in your Python path.

Pre-compiled libraries (using MinGW) are provided for 64-bit Windows. For other operating systems you will need to compile the libraries and executables yourself as described in the README files in the relevant folders. There are also compile_bat.bat files which have examples of how to compile everything.

To use the software on 64-bit Windows you will need the windows_dll directory to be in your PATH. See the setup_paths.bat for an example of how to do this.

## General Notes ##
Questions should be addressed to Hazen Babcock (hbabcock _at_ fas.harvard.edu)
