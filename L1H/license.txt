L1H Compressed Sensing Analysis of STORM Data.

Academic and Non-Commercial Research Use Software License and Terms of Use

The L1H software is designed for the analysis of STORM data using a compressed 
sensing approach. It is particularly well suited for the analysis of 2D STORM 
image data with high emitter density.

The L1H STORM analysis software (the "Software") was developed by Hazen Babcock, 
Jeff Moffit, Yunlong Cao and Xiaowei Zhuang. The project was supported by NIH and 
HHMI. It is distributed for free academic and non-commercial research use by President 
and Fellows of Harvard College ("Harvard").

Using the Software indicates your agreement to be bound by the terms of this 
Software Use Agreement ("Agreement"). Absent your agreement to the terms below, 
you (the "End User") have no rights to hold or use the Software whatsoever.

  does not exclude, however, End User's use of the Software with bona fide collaborators 
  of the End User working on industry-sponsored collaborative research projects. 
  If End User wishes to use Software for commercial purposes or for any other restricted 
  purpose, End User must execute a separate license agreement with the Harvard.
