  <!-- This is basically the same as the minimum height 
       parameter for peak finding in Insight3. You should 
       Use a number roughly equal to the value of the 
       brightest pixel (minus the CCD baseline) in the 
       dimmest peak that you want to detect. If this is 
       too low more background will be detected. If it

  <!-- number of frames in each sub-STORM image. -->
  <frame_step type="int">500</frame_step>
  
  <!-- ... 2 is a good value -->
  <!-- This is the "scale" at which to render the sub-STORM
       images for drift correction. Drift correction works 
       by creating STORM images from frame_step sized groups 
       of frames. These are rendered scaled by the d_scale 
       parameter. For example, if your data is 256x256 pixels 
       then the drift-correction will create 512x512 sub-STORM 
       images (for d_scale = 2) and then attempt to correlate 
       these images to each other to calculate the drift. 
       Using a larger d_scale value creates higher resolution 
       sub-STORM images, but they are also sparser so you 
       might not see any improvement in the drift correction. -->
