       by creating STORM images from frame_step sized groups 
       of frames. These are rendered scaled by the d_scale 
       parameter. For example, if your data is 256x256 pixels 
       then the drift-correction will create 512x512 sub-STORM 
       images (for d_scale = 2) and then attempt to correlate 
       these images to each other to calculate the drift. 
       Using a larger d_scale value creates higher resolution 
       sub-STORM images, but they are also sparser so you 
       might not see any improvement in the drift correction. -->
