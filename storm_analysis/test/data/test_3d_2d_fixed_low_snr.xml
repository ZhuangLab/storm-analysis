       2dfixed - fixed sigma 2d gaussian fitting.
       2d - variable sigma 2d gaussian fitting.
       3d - x, y sigma are independently variable,
            z will be fit after peak fitting.
       Z - x, y sigma depend on z, z is fit as
           part of peak fitting.

       dimmest peak that you want to detect. If this is 
       too low more background will be detected. If it

  <!-- initial guess for sigma -->

       the correct value or the program will generate lots 
       of spurious double and triple peaks. For 2d it should 
       be close, probably within 50% or so of the average 
       peak sigma or the fitting might fail to converge on 
       many peaks. 3d is similar to 2d. It should not effect 
       fitting for Z the model. -->

  <!-- gaussian filter sigma -->

       data has a low SNR this can help for peak finding.
       For optimal sensitivity it should be the same as the
       expected sigma for your peaks.

       You will need to adjust your threshold parameter as
       the threshold is now used for peak finding in the
       convolved image and not the original image.
       
       If you set it to zero (or comment it out) then this
       will not be performed, which can make the analysis
       faster. -->

  <!-- This is the "scale" at which to render the sub-STORM
       images for drift correction. Drift correction works 
       by creating STORM images from frame_step sized groups 
       of frames. These are rendered scaled by the d_scale 
       parameter. For example, if your data is 256x256 pixels 
       then the drift-correction will create 512x512 sub-STORM 
       images (for d_scale = 2) and then attempt to correlate 
       these images to each other to calculate the drift. 
       Using a larger d_scale value creates higher resolution 
       sub-STORM images, but they are also sparser so you 
       might not see any improvement in the drift correction. -->
